Hello world! Welcome to my blog!

With encouragement from [Andrew Albury-Dor](https://andrew.alburydor.com/) and [Jace Benson](https://jace.pro), I've decided to have a go at doing my own tech blog.

My aim is to use this blog to:

* Share some of my opinions, thoughts, ideas, and theories.
* Show off some of the cool stuff I do.
* Sharing some solutions from my secret stash, to give back to the community that's helped me.
* Do some brain-dumping, to get ideas and experiences out of my head and down in writing.

The focus of this blog will be on my ServiceNow adventures, but it'll also include some nifty thoughts and projects in other areas.

I'll likely be updating the blog's look and feel as I go, tweaking it to find what works well.

I hope you enjoy! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
