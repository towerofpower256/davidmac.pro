Hello world! Welcome to my blog!

With encouragement from [Andrew Albury-Dor](https://andrew.alburydor.com/) and [Jace Benson](https://jace.pro), I've decided to have a go at doing my own tech blog.

My aim is to use this blog to:

* Share some of my opinions, thoughts, and ideas.
* Show off some of the cool stuff I do.
* Give back to the community that helped me by sharing some interesting solutions from my adventures.
* Do some brain-dumping to get ideas and experiences down in writing.

I'll likely be updating the blog's look and feel as I go, tweaking it to find what works well.

I hope you enjoy! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
